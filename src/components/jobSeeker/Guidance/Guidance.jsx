              Empower is committed to supporting our workforce not only on
              immediate needs, but providing guidance on long-term goals. In the
              short-term, this means working with our marketing team to identify
              opportunities with our client base that fit best with your needs,
              rather than conforming your skillset to fit an existing client
              need.
            </p>
            <p className="w-[486px] text-left text-[16px] max-sm:w-full">
              In the long-term, this means collaborating with our consultant
              outreach team to discuss options for resume reviews, further
              education, and overall industry guidance.
